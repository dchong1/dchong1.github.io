**Welcome to My Website!**

Thanks for stopping by! This site is my way of sharing a bit about who I am and what keeps me inspired. I’m a finance professional working in the world of **alternative investments**, and I’ve also taught myself to dive into **quant**, finding it pretty exciting to uncover insights through **machine learning and data science**.

When I’m not at work, you’ll likely find me out on the **golf** course, enjoying a **history** podcast, spending quality time with my family, or exploring new places around the world.
